## üöÄ Step 1: One-Click Deployment Accelerator

**Purpose**: Automatically deploy the entire Azure SQL + OpenAI setup for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application using an ARM template.

**Highlights**:
- One-click deployment via Azure Resource Manager (ARM)
- Sets up Azure SQL Database, OpenAI integration, and supporting resources
- Reduces manual configuration to just click and go
- Completes setup in under 5 minutes

**Setup Instructions**:
1. Navigate to the folder [Step1-OneClick-Deployment](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-sql-db-vector-search/tree/main/5-Min-RAG-SQL-Accelerator/Step1-OneClick-Deployment)
2. Follow the instructions in the README to deploy using the ARM template.
3. Once deployed, your backend RAG infrastructure is ready to use.

## üåê Step 2: Web-Based Demo for Vector Search

**Purpose**: Launch a Streamlit-based web UI that showcases Azure SQL‚Äôs native vector search capabilities.

**Highlights**:
- Visual demo for semantic search scenarios (e.g., product search, resume matching)
- No coding required to explore and validate vector search
- Helps users understand and interact with vector search features in Azure SQL

**Setup Instructions**:
1. Navigate to the [Step2-Deploy-RAG-App](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-sql-db-vector-search/tree/main/5-Min-RAG-SQL-Accelerator/Step2-Deploy-RAG-App)
2. Follow the README to install dependencies and run the Streamlit app.
3. Use the web UI to explore vector search on sample data.
