I find it a bit more expensive than I had hoped it would be, but then again there is no waste and I consider that in itself a savings alone.

I&#39;ve had varying success with about 7 different kinds of canned food.  This one is a hit with both.  It&#39;s natural, mostly organic, doesn&#39;t have any junk or fillers, and I have peace of mind knowing that we&#39;re giving them high quality food from an ethical company.  Since they&#39;ve been on this diet they are more active, alert and happy.  Their coats are so soft and shiny and they seem to be shedding less.  Cannot say how relieved I am to have finally found a food they like that is so good for them as well.  It is pricey but if you want to save on costly vet bills down the road due to illness caused by poor nutrition, this is the way to go.</td><td>0.5938018327837162</td></tr><tr><td>B001EX9LGQ</td><td>Catfood</td><td>Very Healthy ingredients..compared to store brands..My&lt;br /&gt;cats love this..they are Fussy Eaters..so I think many&lt;br /&gt;cats would love this food..Will Buy it again.</td><td>0.5685298553173851</td></tr><tr><td>B003R0LKSG</td><td>Excellent Grain-Free Option</td><td>We recently adopted a new kitten. We rotate Felidae grain-free canned formula with Wellness Turkey canned food. He loves both and eats well, he&#39;s never left a single whole pea behind. This is a very high-quality cat food, using excellent all-meat proteins. He is healthy, active,affectionate, and has a smooth glossy coat. Definitely worth the cost in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe it is worthwhile to rotate different (high-quality) canned foods for variety and to not create a cat who will ONLY eat one brand. I think this is useful also in the event of a recall. I&#39;m looking for a 3rd high-quality brand to add to the rotation.</td><td>0.567794291363927</td></tr><tr><td>B003SE19UK</td><td>Healthy &amp; They LOVE It!</td><td>My holistic vet recommended this, along with a few other brands. We tried them all, but my cats prefer this (especially the sardine version). The best part is their coats are so soft and clean and their eyes are so clear. AND (and I don&#39;t want to be rude, so I&#39;ll say this as delicately as I can) their waste is far less odorous than cats who eat the McDonalds junk found in most stores, which is a definite plus for me! The health benefits are so obvious - I highly recommend Holistic Select!</td><td>0.5660357548382248</td></tr><tr><td>B000VK6NDC</td><td>16 cats love it...</td><td>I have 16 cats ranging from 1 to 11 yrs old and every single one of them likes this.  I have tried Wellness, Holistic, Avoderm, Chicken Soup for the..., Merck Homestyle, BG (Before Grain), California Natural, and Evangers with mixed results.  This is the first canned food that all of them will not only eat but eat all of it.  I&#39;ve fed them the Chicken and Liver flavor and the Seafood flavor so far and they seem to like both equally.  I find it a bit more expensive than I had hoped it would be, but then again there is no waste and I consider that in itself a savings alone.  I&#39;m a firm believer in better ingredients and less fillers and allergens make for less poop, less litter use, fewer trips to the vet and an overall healthier cat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I have tried all the flavors on my cats and the chicken and liver seems to be the one they like the most.  They have now officially rejected all the other flavors including the seafood flavor that they originally liked.  I also wanted to add that this is a very STRONG smelling brand of cat food, almost overpowering when I open the cans at feeding time.</td><td>0.5651492019114439</td></tr><tr><td>B000VK6NDC</td><td>NOTHING BUT THE BEST 4 MY CATS</td><td>I have found this cat food to be the purrfect choice for both my cat with IBD and my cat with Diabetes. Howard and Miss C are thriving on this diet of Turkey and brown rice and  enjoy it so much more than prescription diets. The price was great too for a premium cat food.</td><td>0.5573018658437633</td></tr><tr><td>B002PNGY28</td><td>Great soft little treats for your finicky feline</td><td>I have 2 cats.  One will eat anything.  The other one is soooo picky.  She&#39;s had to have some of her teeth removed due to a mouth virus, so I needed to find some good soft treats.  She likes these more than anything I&#39;ve tried.  They are really thing little tiny strips.  I like Wellness, all natural products.  Both cats like their brand cat food as well.</td><td>0.5509418911759418</td></tr><tr><td>B003SE19UK</td><td>Great food.</td><td>I have done a lot of research to find the best food for my cat, and this is an excellent food.  That is also according to my holistic veterinarian.  They put probiotics on the kibble as the last step, which is very important to me.  The best thing is that my cat loved it immediately and I had to stop mixing it with the old food because she only would eat Holistic Select.</td><td>0.5468060504753443</td></tr><tr><td>B00180O980</td><td>Less expensive, high quality food</td><td>I feed prowl because it is a high quality healthy food that does not break my budget.  It is much cheaper than other premium wet foods (Wellness, Weruva, etc), and my cat seems to like it.  The only downside to prowl is that, since it is dehydrated, you must mix it with water and wait 10 minutes before serving.  My kitten meows at me the entire time.&lt;br /&gt;I started my cat on Prowl because my vet offered a free sample. She ate it right away with no problems.  However, she&#39;d only ever had &quot;healthy&quot; food, so I was not transitioning from an unhealthy grain filled (but addictively tasty) food.&lt;br /&gt;It is very easy to digest and may be a solution for cats with digestion problems.  I recommend (like another reviewer) that you order a free sample and give it a try.</td><td>0.5448324548665336</td></tr></table>"

My dogs did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: \"When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs.\" Basically, dogs cannot digest corn, it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.<br /><br />I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural, organic foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness.",

This was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight; not good for the rest of them.  Our other male went from a slightly chunky 18.5 lbs to an obese 21.25 lbs - almost three pounds in 6 weeks!  The 3 females gained between 1.5 to 2 pounds each.  We noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl, like they couldn't seem to get full.  We also saw a lessening of coat quality - lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly (including with a furminator) and one developed bad dandruff.  The stools developed a really bad odor, although I do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which I am grateful for.  Most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened.<br /><br />I am very disgusted with Science Diet - they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags. One of the sites I researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available.  If you compare the various Science diet formulae that have different health claims on them - the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two.  Basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are  the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive.  With other brands, such as innova or royal canin, there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae.<br /><br />Now to deal with the weight gain, as well as the other problems we noted, we are switching foods again.  This time we are trying royal canin indoor mature.  Wish us luck.",

Blue Buffalo a great product that you can still feed your pets with confidence. Because it doesn't contain any cheap fillers, it's more satisfying to your dog so you don't need to feed as much of it thus making it still relatively economical.

This was NOT cheap food folks. This was a well-known brand, highly marketed as \"Natural\", that we were paying $60/bag for. The FDA analysis of this food verified that it contained toxins, but NOTHING was done to the dog food manufacturer. They are still producing their \"high priced waste\" and heavily marketing it as \"natural\".<br /><br />My advice to pet owners: Read the ingredients labels thoroughly and often! Blue Buffalo a great product that you can still feed your pets with confidence. Because it doesn't contain any cheap fillers, it's more satisfying to your dog so you don't need to feed as much of it thus making it still relatively economical. Don't wait until it's too late for your beloved pet. \"",

As pet owners were willing to spend more money feeding their pets, larger corporations bought out the smaller dog food companies and changed the ingredients without notifying the customers. This was particularly true of the more expensive brands that contained the higher quality ingredients. Real meat and rice were substituted with &quot;meat by-product&quot; and cheap imported grains (particularly CORN) that were determined to be &quot;unfit for human consumption&quot;. They are taking ingredients that used to be considered &quot;waste&quot; and packaging it up as &quot;healthy &amp; nutritious&quot; food for your beloved pet. Our once healthy pets are contracting debilitating diseases and dying because of the toxic waste materials that are currently being marketed as pet food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blue Buffalo is one of the few remaining companies that, at least to my knowledge, has not &quot;sold-out&quot; yet. The food really is nutritious and still contains real meat with no by-products, fillers, corn or soy. We switched our dogs over this past summer after having lost one to an autopsy/toxicology verified case of &quot;aflatoxin poisoning&quot; from the &quot;healthy &amp; nutritious&quot; dog food we were buying and feeding him. This was NOT cheap food folks. This was a well-known brand, highly marketed as &quot;Natural&quot;, that we were paying $60/bag for. The FDA analysis of this food verified that it contained toxins, but NOTHING was done to the dog food manufacturer. They are still producing their &quot;high priced waste&quot; and heavily marketing it as &quot;natural&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice to pet owners: Read the ingredients labels thoroughly and often! Blue Buffalo a great product that you can still feed your pets with confidence. Because it doesn&#39;t contain any cheap fillers, it&#39;s more satisfying to your dog so you don&#39;t need to feed as much of it thus making it still relatively economical. Don&#39;t wait until it&#39;s too late for your beloved pet. &quot;</td><td>Title: Not what I thought; Content: As other viewers have pointed out, this dog food contains pesticides and grains, among other questionable ingredients.

As you can see I&#39;m not a fan of these k cups.  These are the worst ever.</td><td>0.4859990236413786</td><td>Detailed Review</td><td>Low Score</td></tr><tr><td>8656</td><td>B003VXFK44</td><td>A222AGYJ4N33F7</td><td>1</td><td>Ewwwww!!!!</td><td>Really?  Who blends this stuff and decides that it is good?  Ugh.  I can sum this nastyness up in one quick phrase.  Stale airline coffee!  If you like that flavor, then you will love this one, if you don&#39;t like thin cardboard soaked, never washed the pot out, and the water came from a tin canteen, flavored coffee, then you won&#39;t like this one either!  I would give this zero stars if I could.  WOW, likely the worst cup of coffee that I have ever had.  I hope Wolfy reads this as his name is on the package and I expected more, now I know not to buy any of his signature products, awesome, thanks for saving me $$ next time!  The package says Extra Bold, but it doesn&#39;t taste extra bold.  It&#39;s almost like they put some ground instant powder in the mix to make it stronger.</td><td>Title: Ewwwww!!!!; Content: Really?  Who blends this stuff and decides that it is good?  Ugh.

I was hoping it would be good so I bought 2 cans. After 1 cup, I threw both cans away. If you want a really great cherry hot chocolate, add 3-4 teaspoons of the cherry juice from a jar of maraschino cherries to your favorite milk hot chocolate. YUM!!! Add more if you use dark hot chocolate.</td><td>Title: Awful!!!; Content: I love hot chocolate and am always trying new ones, but this was the absolute worst cherry hot chocolate I have ever tasted!!
