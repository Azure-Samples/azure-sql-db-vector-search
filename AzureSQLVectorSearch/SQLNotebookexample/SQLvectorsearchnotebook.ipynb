The only good quality dry foods they will eat are Wellness and Innova. Innova's manufacturer was recently purchased by Procter&Gamble. I began looking for a replacement. After once again offering several samples (from my local holistic pet store) Holistic Select was the only one (other than the usual Wellness and Innova) they would eat. For finicky cats, I recommend trying Holistic Select. It is a good quality food that is very palatable for finicky eaters.",

I always offered both canned and dry, but wish I would have fed them premium quality canned food and limited dry food. I have two 15 year old cats and two 5 year old cats. The only good quality dry foods they will eat are Wellness and Innova. Innova&#39;s manufacturer was recently purchased by Procter&amp;Gamble. I began looking for a replacement. After once again offering several samples (from my local holistic pet store) Holistic Select was the only one (other than the usual Wellness and Innova) they would eat. For finicky cats, I recommend trying Holistic Select. It is a good quality food that is very palatable for finicky eaters.</td><td>0.6271999928953957</td></tr><tr><td>B000VK6NDC</td><td>Highest quality, delicious food for your cats!</td><td>My cats both LOVE this food.  I&#39;ve had varying success with about 7 different kinds of canned food.  This one is a hit with both.  It&#39;s natural, mostly organic, doesn&#39;t have any junk or fillers, and I have peace of mind knowing that we&#39;re giving them high quality food from an ethical company.  Since they&#39;ve been on this diet they are more active, alert and happy.  Their coats are so soft and shiny and they seem to be shedding less.  Cannot say how relieved I am to have finally found a food they like that is so good for them as well.  It is pricey but if you want to save on costly vet bills down the road due to illness caused by poor nutrition, this is the way to go.</td><td>0.5938018327837162</td></tr><tr><td>B001EX9LGQ</td><td>Catfood</td><td>Very Healthy ingredients..compared to store brands..My&lt;br /&gt;cats love this..they are Fussy Eaters..so I think many&lt;br /&gt;cats would love this food..Will Buy it again.</td><td>0.5685298553173851</td></tr><tr><td>B003R0LKSG</td><td>Excellent Grain-Free Option</td><td>We recently adopted a new kitten.

This is a very high-quality cat food, using excellent all-meat proteins. He is healthy, active,affectionate, and has a smooth glossy coat. Definitely worth the cost in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe it is worthwhile to rotate different (high-quality) canned foods for variety and to not create a cat who will ONLY eat one brand.

After switching him over to Castor and Pollux Indoor Cat Formula he eats much less now.<br /><br />Also, By-Product means just that...beaks, feathers, toe-nail clippings, meat not suitable for human consumption, dead animals, etc. -- Totally not worth the $$$ ...it's cheaper just to dig in the trash and puree it yourself (doesn't sound so appealing does it??). Science Diet is notorious for implying superior quality products when they are in fact no better than all the other terrible pet food you find. Don't let your vet fool you either- vets usually get a 40% cut from Hill's to sell you their cat food.<br /><br />My recommendation is to use common sense and to do some research. Try brands like Newmans Own or Castor and Pollux as they have wholesome ingredients and a proven track record.<br /><br />I later called the shelter only to hear that they are required to feed the animals Science Diet as it is donated and they have a special arrangement with Petsmart to house their animals in their in store adoption centers. A requirement is to exclusively feed Science Diet to the animals.<br /><br />TRY THIS INSTEAD: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BCUBZ0\">Castor & Pollux Ultramix Indoor Feline Fomula Dry Cat Food, 15-Pound Bag</a>",

This was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight; not good for the rest of them.  Our other male went from a slightly chunky 18.5 lbs to an obese 21.25 lbs - almost three pounds in 6 weeks!  The 3 females gained between 1.5 to 2 pounds each.  We noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl, like they couldn't seem to get full.  We also saw a lessening of coat quality - lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly (including with a furminator) and one developed bad dandruff.  The stools developed a really bad odor, although I do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which I am grateful for.  Most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened.<br /><br />I am very disgusted with Science Diet - they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags. One of the sites I researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available.  If you compare the various Science diet formulae that have different health claims on them - the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two.  Basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are  the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive.  With other brands, such as innova or royal canin, there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae.<br /><br />Now to deal with the weight gain, as well as the other problems we noted, we are switching foods again.

His numbers didn't warrant being on prescription food yet, but we needed to start paying attention to things like protein and phosphorus levels in his food.  Because we have five cats, and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time, we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest, so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older cats.<br /><br />Since we made the switch 6 weeks ago, all of the cats have gained weight.  This was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight; not good for the rest of them.  Our other male went from a slightly chunky 18.5 lbs to an obese 21.25 lbs - almost three pounds in 6 weeks!  The 3 females gained between 1.5 to 2 pounds each.  We noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl, like they couldn't seem to get full.  We also saw a lessening of coat quality - lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly (including with a furminator) and one developed bad dandruff.  The stools developed a really bad odor, although I do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which I am grateful for.  Most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened.<br /><br />I am very disgusted with Science Diet - they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags. One of the sites I researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available.  If you compare the various Science diet formulae that have different health claims on them - the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two.  Basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are  the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive.  With other brands, such as innova or royal canin, there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae.<br /><br />Now to deal with the weight gain, as well as the other problems we noted, we are switching foods again.

His numbers didn&#39;t warrant being on prescription food yet, but we needed to start paying attention to things like protein and phosphorus levels in his food.  Because we have five cats, and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time, we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest, so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older cats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since we made the switch 6 weeks ago, all of the cats have gained weight.  This was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight; not good for the rest of them.  Our other male went from a slightly chunky 18.5 lbs to an obese 21.25 lbs - almost three pounds in 6 weeks!  The 3 females gained between 1.5 to 2 pounds each.  We noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl, like they couldn&#39;t seem to get full.  We also saw a lessening of coat quality - lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly (including with a furminator) and one developed bad dandruff.  The stools developed a really bad odor, although I do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which I am grateful for.  Most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very disgusted with Science Diet - they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags. One of the sites I researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available.  If you compare the various Science diet formulae that have different health claims on them - the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two.  Basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are  the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive.  With other brands, such as innova or royal canin, there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to deal with the weight gain, as well as the other problems we noted, we are switching foods again.  This time we are trying royal canin indoor mature.  Wish us luck.</td><td>Title: Kitty Junk Food; Content: We have five cats - one an elderly cat of 15 years, the other four in the 9-11 year range.

Now, I will say I brew it on&lt;br /&gt;the &quot;large cup&quot; (9.25 oz, I believe) setting on our Keurig, so maybe it&#39;s&lt;br /&gt;a bit better on the 8oz setting, or even the small setting.  But Caribou (we&lt;br /&gt;also like Donut Shop, Green Mountain Kona Blend 10%, etc.) can be easily&lt;br /&gt;brewed on 9.25 and hold a good bold taste.  This coffee doesn&#39;t&lt;br /&gt;hold a CANDLE to any of those.  Now I&#39;m stuck with 40+ of these. Blech...maybe&lt;br /&gt;the guests won&#39;t mind it! :)</td><td>0.5143298503388504</td><td>Detailed Review</td><td>Medium Score</td></tr><tr><td>3327</td><td>B005K4Q1VI</td><td>ANTA6BNDLCQP5</td><td>1</td><td>NASTY</td><td>Since I am willing to try alot of new things.

I could not finish the shake I had mixed up, and had to wash my mouth out with apple juice to get that sick taste out before I could actually eat or drink anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a terrible protein powder from the standpoint of taste, in my opinion.  Of all the types I have tried, which is many, this has taken seat as the new &quot;worst&quot; one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, I had ordered this with another brand because I am testing egg protein powders due to casein sensitivity.  If anyone has an egg protein powder recommendation, PM me.</td><td>Title: A Protein Powder to make you Gag.; Content: I have tried many different protein powders over the years, and while it is hard to write a review based on taste alone (since everyone&#39;s taste is different), I&#39;m going to go ahead and say this is the most rancid tasting gunk I have ever had the displeasure of putting in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mix my protein shakes with a hand blender, so I rarely have any mixing problems - and even this protein mixed well.
